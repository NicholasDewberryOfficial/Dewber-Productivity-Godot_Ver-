Dewber-Productivity-Godot_Ver-
A productivity tool for people like me.

# What is this?
This is a productivity suite that's tailor made for me - Nicholas Dewberry. 

You can use it if you want, I guess.

# Why I made this:
Every month, I used to have a master google docs document that was chock-full of my notes, thoughts and day to day activities. 

Imagine a todo list with 40 things on it. Whenever I did something, I'd cross it off. 

This was chaotic for the following reasons:
- Sometimes tasks have a lot of master tasks, and chaining was impossible
- Some tasks would bleed over from week to week, and thus
- No tagging system - I would have things for different classes all 


- I like super productivity, but hate the notifications/little annoying quirks
- I like todo lists, but I want a little more power
- I like godot, and I think I could make something less resource intensive than current electron projects.
- I like keyboard based workflows, and I want something very comfortable.


# Why godot?
- It's REALLY, REALLY easy to make stuff in here, and make it look good.
- I can also port to mobile devices.
